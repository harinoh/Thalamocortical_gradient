# Thalamocortical gradient 📈📉

A Python-based pipeline for analyzing gradient changes in thalamocortical connectivity between two groups.
<br><br/>

## 📋 Overview

1. Gradient analysis
    - Implements connectopic mapping to analyze thalamic gradients (adapted from congrads)
    - Generates projection maps (pmaps)
      
2. Statistical analysis
    - Performs group-level statistical comparisons of gradients
    - Produces publication-ready figures

3. Stepwise functional connectivity
    - Provides additional stepwise functional connectivity analysis (MATLAB-based)


*Note: These scripts assume that resting-state fMRI data have already been preprocessed. Detailed preprocessing steps can be found in the [fMRI_Preprocessing](https://github.com/harinoh/fMRI_Preprocessing) repository.*
